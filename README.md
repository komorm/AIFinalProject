# AIFinalProject
There are many ways of multiclass classification,  this project tested out several of these ways and especially focusing on the K nearest neighbor classifier to find out the models with the best performance for classifying the sex of abalone's in the data set. It turns out that logistic regression has the best precision and accuracy however, a tuned K nearest neighbor classifier is only approximately 0.5-1 percentage point less accurate/precise. Finally, the tuned KNN algorithm was used successfully to create a valid predictive model for the dataset classifying based on sex.
